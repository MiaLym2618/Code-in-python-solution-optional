In the game Fizz Buzz, players take turns counting up from one. 
If a player’s turn lands on a number that’s divisible by 3, she should say “Fizz” instead of the number, and if it lands on a number that’s divisible by 5, she should say “Buzz” instead of the number. 
If the number is both a multiple of 3 and of 5, she should say "Fizzbuzz" instead of the number. A spectator sport, it is not. 

What it is, however, is an interesting problem in control flow and parameter usage. Write a function called fizzbuzz which accepts as a parameter an integer called n. 
The function should return what a player should say if it is the number n on their turn. 
Here are a few examples: 
  fizzbuzz(8) # returns 8 
  fizzbuzz(10) # returns "Buzz" 
  fizzbuzz(3) # returns "Fizz"
Next, complete your program by writing a main function that plays Fizz Buzz up to 17. Here's a sample run of the program: 
example:
  ----------------------------
  1 
  2 
  Fizz 
  4 
  Buzz
