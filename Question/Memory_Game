Write a program that has a user play a memory game using lists.

This Python programming assignment will guide you through the exciting process of creating your own memory game, a classic and engaging exercise that tests your ability to remember and match pairs of items. 
In this game the cards will be represented as numbers in a list and their location will be indices of the list. By completing this project, you will practice critical list concepts. 
Not only will this enhance your problem-solving skills, but you will also have a lot of fun as you watch the game come to life and challenge yourself or your friends to find all the pairs.

Milestone #1: Create the truth list.
  Use a for loop to create a list that has the values  0  through  NUM_PAIRS - 1  twice. So for example if  NUM_PAIRS = 3 as in the example, your list should have this value:
  [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]

Milestone #2: Shuffle the list. 
  The python random library has a special function called shuffle which will randomly order the values in a list. 
  Call that function on your list and then print out the result. Print out the list to make sure it looks shuffled! Assuming that your list from the previous milestone was named truth
  hint:
    random.shuffle(truth)
    print(truth)

Milestone #3: Create a displayed list
  In this program you will need to keep track of a separate list, which is the one to display to the user. 
  We use the '*' symbol to denote that a value is hidden to the user (otherwise we display the value). Initially displayed should be a list of '*' values which is the same length as truth. If  NUM_PAIRS = 3:
  ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*']

Milestone #4: Get two valid indices from the user
  Write logic to get two valid indices from the user. A valid index satisfies the following:
    - A valid number, greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to the index of the last element in the list.
    - The value of the displayed list at that index must be '*' (i.e. it has not yet been uncovered/matched).
    - The second index the user supplies in the pair must not be equal to the first (i.e. the two indices supplied must be distinct)
  If the user does not enter a valid index, repeatedly prompt them until they do. We recommend that you define a new function get_valid_index which takes in the displayed list and returns the valid index the user entered.
  
  Here are specific strings we are expecting for you to print out when the user doesn't enter a valid index:
    - Entering the same index twice
      - "You entered the same index twice. Try again."
    - Number is out-of-bounds
      - "Invalid index. Try again."
    - Non-number.
      - "Not a number. Try again."
    - Inputting an index that has already been revealed
      - "This number has already been matched. Try again."

Milestone #5: Check correct.
  Get two valid inputs from the user and check if there is a match (the values of the indices in the truth lists are equal).
    - If the values don't match:
      - Do not update the displayed list. 
      - Print out the values at the two guessed indices.
      - Print "No match. Try again."
      - Use input() to wait for the user to press the "Enter" key before continuing
    - If the values do match:
      - Update the displayed list
      - Print "Match!"
      - Do not print the values at each guessed index or wait for the user to press "Enter" to continue, as is done if there is not a match

  Imagine the current value of displayed and truth lists are as follows:
  [2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0] # truth_list
  ['*', '*', '*', '*', 0, 0] # displayed_list
  Since the user got a match the display list will be updated to [2, '*', '*', 2, 0, 0]

Milestone #6: Play multiple turns.
  The user should play until all the pairs have been correctly located. Between turns make sure to call clear_terminal. 
  At the end of the game, tell the user that they have won by printing 'Congratulations! You won!'

example game:
  --------------------------------------------
  truth_list = [0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2]
  --------------------------------------------
  ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*']
  Enter an index: 0
  Enter an index: 1
  Value at index 0 is 0
  Value at index 1 is 1
  No match. Try again. 
  Press Enter to continue... <User presses "Enter" key>
  <terminal is cleared by calling clear_terminal()>
  ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*']
  Enter an index: 0
  Enter an index: 2
  Match!
  <terminal is cleared by calling clear_terminal()>
  [0, '*', 0, '*', '*', '*']
  Enter an index: 1
  Enter an index: 3
  Match!
  <terminal is cleared by calling clear_terminal()>
  [0, 1, 0, 1, '*', '*']
  Enter an index: 4
  Enter an index: 5
  Match!
  <terminal is cleared by calling clear_terminal()>
  [0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2]
  Congratulations! You won!
